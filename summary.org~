* JD NORMAN INDUSTRIES v. CITY OF LESLIE, Mich: Court of Appeals 2015

Court of Appeals upholds TCV of $6,219,900 despite Norman having bought the business for $6,632,250 and only $1,672,000 of the property being in the taxing jurisdiction. 

The Tribunal gave no weight to the sale, distiguishing a business sale vs an asset sale. 

The Court of Appeals approved, saying this was enough for the Tribunal to circumvent Jones & Laughlin and give no weight to the sale. 

The big mistake was made at the hearing. The appraisal was excluded as hearsay because the appraiser was not there to lay the foundation.
